NAME
    Test::Reporter::Transport::Socket - Simple socket transport for
    Test::Reporter

SYNOPSIS
        my $report = Test::Reporter->new(
            transport => 'Socket',
            transport_args => [
              host     => 'metabase.relay.example.com',
              port     => 58008,
            ],
        );

        # use space-separated in a CPAN::Reporter config.ini
        transport = Socket host metabase.relay.example.com ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Test::Reporter::Transport that sends test report data
    serialised over a TCP socket.

    The idea is to keep dependencies in the tester perl to a bear minimum
    and offload the bulk of submission to a Metabase instance to a relay.

USAGE
    See Test::Reporter and Test::Reporter::Transport for general usage
    information.

  Transport arguments
    Unlike most other Transport classes, this class requires transport
    arguments to be provided as key-value pairs:

        my $report = Test::Reporter->new(
            transport => 'Socket',
            transport_args => [
              host     => 'metabase.relay.example.com',
              port     => 58008,
            ],
        );

    Arguments include:

    "host" (required)
        The name or IP address of a host where we want to send our
        serialised data.

    "port"
        The TCP port on the above "host" to send our serialised data.

METHODS
    These methods are only for internal use by Test::Reporter.

  new
        my $sender = Test::Reporter::Transport::Socket->new( %params );

    The "new" method is the object constructor.

  send
        $sender->send( $report );

    The "send" method transmits the report.
